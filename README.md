# Fuckers' way

- Have you ever tried writing brainfuck?
- Have you ever got a headache?
- Do you like playing video games?
- Do you like solving puzzles?

If you answered "yes" to at least 3 of those 4 questions, you might want to play Fuckers' way.

in this game, you have to write brainfuck code to control your character in order to make it to the finish.

The first index of the brainfuck array controls the x position of the character, and the second index the y position.
All other indexes aren't used for now, but will soon be ;-)

Stay tuned!

## Installation
First of all, clone the repo where you want
```shell
git clone https://github.com/M4gicalCat/FuckersWay
```
Then, compile the typescript source
```shell
tsc
```

Finally, open the index.html file in a web browser.
That's it, you can play the game.

Good luck!
